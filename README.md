# UFont

## Motivation

UFont stands for Universal Font. This library was built with the purpose of defining a model that could allow for easy font management. A Ufont can be serialized, compared, and modified in a platform independent way. At usage time, we can transform it to a SwiftUI.Font, a UIFont or a NSFont.

Documentation for releases and main features of the library are available in the
"Documentation" folder".

# UFont 🖋️

## Motivation

UFont stands for Universal Font. This library was built with the purpose of defining a model that could allow for easy font management. A Ufont can be serialized, compared, and modified in a platform independent way. At usage time, we can transform it to a SwiftUI.Font, a UIFont or a NSFont. 


## Installation

Use it with swift package manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.org/tyrissoftware/swift-ufont.git", from: "0.1.1")
